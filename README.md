Project Workflow

1. Data Cleaning
	•	Removed inconsistencies, missing values, and erroneous entries
	•	Standardized variable formats and data types
	•	Filtered the dataset to include only accidents involving injuries or deaths

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
	•	Examined variable distributions and key metrics
	•	Conducted temporal, spatial, and categorical analysis
	•	Produced visualizations to identify trends and underlying pattern

All findings are summarized in a presentation. The presentation includes:
	•	key insights from the EDA
	•	trends related to injury and fatal accidents
	•	contributing factors
	•	suggestions and considerations for prevention
